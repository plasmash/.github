## What is Plasma?

A complete digital operating system for organizations - sensing what's happening, processing intelligently, and responding appropriately in real-time.

### Core Philosophy
**Real-time intelligence** - every component processes, analyzes, and acts on data as it happens.

### Key Features
- 🧠 **AI-Native**: ML/AI workloads as first-class citizens
- ⚡ **Real-time Processing**: Instant data processing and response
- 🔧 **Composable Architecture**: Reusable, interconnected components
- 🎯 **Event-Driven**: Trigger flows based on real-world conditions
- 🔓 **Open Source**: Transparent and customizable
- 🏢 **Enterprise-Ready**: Security, compliance, and scalability included

## Architecture

**5-Layer System**

- **Foundation**: Infrastructure provisioning and observability collection
- **Integration**: Central data exchange hub (all data flows through here)
- **Cognition**: AI/ML processing, analytics, and real-time intelligence
- **Conversation**: Natural language processing and AI interactions
- **Interaction**: Dashboards, visualization, and external system interfaces

## Component Model

Plasma uses **two parallel three-layer patterns**:

### Flow Components (Event-Driven Logic)
Function (computation) → Skill (configuration) → Flow (orchestration)
- **Functions**: Universal computational units (e.g., `washer` function)
- **Skills**: Configured functions for specific use cases (e.g., `car-wash`, `hand-wash`)
- **Flows**: Event-triggered execution (e.g., "wash car when returns from countryside")

### Application Components (Infrastructure)
Software (computation) → Service (configuration) → Application (orchestration)
- **Softwares**: Core programs (e.g., Postgres, Grafana)
- **Services**: Configured deployments (e.g., `dashboards_postgres`, `dashboards_grafana`)
- **Applications**: Orchestrated business capabilities (e.g., `dashboards` app)

## Use Cases

- Digital Agencies: Project and communication management
- Enterprises: Real-Time Business Intelligence and Automation
- Industry: Real-Time Operations Intelligence Platform
- Startups: Rapid scaling with built-in best practices
- Data Teams: Real-Time analytics and ML pipelines

## Deployment

Deploy anywhere:
- On-premise and private clouds
- Public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Hybrid and multi-cloud environments
